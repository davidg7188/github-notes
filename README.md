### Git:
 It helps with version control, so instead of having to keep track of separate files, git is a software that does that for you. Git keeps track of the entire history of things worked on the computer. Git also works with other people at the same time which is great for collaboration.
### Github:
 **Git** and **Github** are _NOT_ the same. Github is a website/webservice where you can use **git** itself on projects. 
### Repo: 
 Also mean repository, in other words its a project full of files. This is where everyhthing gets done. 
### Commit:
 It's a save button. You can name each commit you make and in the end you can see the history of every commit. Commit hash is a very large number given to each commit, an identifier.
